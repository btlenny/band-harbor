# Challenges
- I was excited to learn React from the beginning of this cohort and am looking forward to continue to build more React apps. This first app I found very challenging in a good way. Wrapping my head around prop drilling how to setup my page was what maybe slowed me down the most on this app. 

# Next Steps
- My initial intention was to create a site that utilized the Spotify API as its main resource, but was unable to get it to work. Will get that implemented next.
- Currently users have to input a URL to upload album art, but it would be ideal do setup a database so users can upload a photo
- Mobile functionality. Currently it's difficult to navigate on mobile
